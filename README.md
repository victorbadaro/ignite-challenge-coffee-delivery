# Ignite Coffee Delivery

This project was developed during Rocketseat's Ignite course.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
